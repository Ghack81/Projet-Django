# Projet Django

## Created a Website with Python and Django

Welcome to the Python, Django, and SQLite tutorial! In this tutorial, 
we will dive into the world of web development using Python, 
one of the most popular programming languages, and Django, 
a powerful web framework, along with SQLite, a lightweight and easy-to-use database management system. 
Whether you're a beginner looking to learn web development from scratch or an experienced programmer
looking to expand your skills, this tutorial will provide you with a comprehensive 
guide on building web applications using these technologies. We will cover the basics of Python,
introduce you to Django, and show you how to use SQLite as a database backend for your web applications. 
So, let's get started and build some amazing web applications with Python, Django, and SQLite !

## The relationship of Python, Django and Sqlite in a website.

Python is a popular programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development. Django, on the other hand, is a high-level Python web framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for building web applications quickly and efficiently. Django follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps in separating the different components of a web application.

SQLite, on the other hand, is a lightweight and serverless relational database management system that is often used in web applications for storing and retrieving data. It stores data in a self-contained, file-based database, making it easy to integrate with web applications without requiring a separate database server.

In a typical web application built using Python, Django, and SQLite, the relationship works as follows:

Python: Python serves as the programming language for building the web application. It is used to write the backend logic, including handling HTTP requests, processing data, and implementing business logic.

Django: Django provides the web framework that helps in structuring the application and handling various aspects of web development, such as URL routing, view rendering, authentication, and more. Django also includes an object-relational mapper (ORM), which allows developers to define their application models and interact with the SQLite database using Python classes.

SQLite: SQLite acts as the backend database for storing and retrieving data in the web application. Django's ORM provides an abstraction layer that allows developers to interact with the SQLite database using Python classes and methods, abstracting away the underlying SQL queries.

In summary, Python is the programming language, Django is the web framework that provides tools and libraries for building web applications, and SQLite is the backend database that stores and retrieves data for the web application. Together, they form a powerful combination for building dynamic and data-driven web applications using Python.
